    "Welcome to our end-to-end example of distributed image classification algorithm in transfer learning mode. In this demo, we will use the Amazon sagemaker image classification algorithm in transfer learning mode to fine-tune a pre-trained model (trained on imagenet data) to learn to classify a new dataset. In particular, the pre-trained model will be fine-tuned using [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). \n",
