Extensive experiments demonstrate that ELMo representations work extremely well in practice.
We first show that they can be easily added to existing models for six diverse and challenging language understanding problems, including textual entailment, question answering and sentiment analysis.
The addition of ELMo representations alone significantly improves the state of the art in every case, including up to 20% relative error reductions.
For tasks where direct comparisons are possible, ELMo outperforms CoVe (McCann et al., 2017), which computes contextualized representations using a neural machine translation encoder.
Finally, an analysis of both ELMo and CoVe reveals that deep representations outperform those derived from just the top layer of an LSTM.
Our trained models and code are publicly available, and we expect that ELMo will provide similar gains for many other NLP problems.
